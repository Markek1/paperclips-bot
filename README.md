[Universal Paperclips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Paperclips) is an incremental game about paperclips. Initially you have to manually click a button to produce paperclips, but over time you can sell them and use the money to buy machines that build clips automatically. As time goes on, many more features become available.

This script automates the initial stages of the game: manually making clips, setting the correct price based on supply and demand, building autoclippers, distributing trust, buying projects and other tasks
